### Interacting with the World

Every Nation, City and Village in the world is fully simluated across multiple Threads that operate their economy and AI whether the player is present or not.  Each one has its own regional attributes, military units and trade operations that respond to their surroundings.  Some are near to hostile Nations and Tribes and must focus on defense and martial professions, whereas some others prioritise peaceful trade and order.  Depending on what actions the player may take, they can all be influenced to forge future Alliances to differing goals.

### World Travel

Accessed via the World Map, time compression in Almerra allows for unrestricted passage to anywhere in the world within a short time as long as you are not in combat.
 
The travel system is usable at anytime with the understanding that movement speeds will be greatly reduced as will the number of days required to reach the destination if you are not riding a mount or vessel.
