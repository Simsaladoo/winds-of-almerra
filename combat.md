### WIP
### Mount & Blade influences
This gameplay is set within an expansive, seamless open-world, with multiple continents only explorable through sailing across the vast seas of Almerra.  Diverse classes of vessels are in-use by the many Nations and purchase-able by the player to be used to freely roam and transport forces and goods.  Larger vessels can even transport Mounts (within reason) used by heavy cavalry for that extra Age of Empires-influenced kick.

Hundreds of units may be involved in every battle as the different Nations attempt to expand their reach for resources and power.  They can set sail and raid another kingdom or dispatch an army to siege an entire town if they have their strength built up enough.  You as the player can choose to incorporate into these situations and turn them into your own gambit or aid in their resistance to dictate your own will upon the nations.  The melee and ranged combat is as close to Warband/Bannerlord as we can be done, with our own custom features added on-top.  Directional attacks, kicks, shield bashes, throwing and ranged weapons can be used across on-foot, horseback, camelback, elephantback and naval combat engagements.  Its all up to your own ideas on how they are best utilized.

### AI Combat Testing
Almerra is heavily inspired by the Mount & Blade series, using player-driven directional movement and attacks with velocity modifiers to dictate the force behind each swing.  This is partnered with physical materials and other features within Unreal to model the combat stat structures.
