### Humble beginnings

The development of a fully open-world RPG has so many ingredients.  From the core gameplay loops to the mechanics and are generally easier said than done.  Take Witcher 3, for example--Take a contract, investigate, resolve it, get paid (or not), and repeat.  But in doing each of those steps the player will utilize movement, UI, NPC interactions, combat system, inventory, world/level design, shader performance and tech and SO much more.  

Almerra has had very few people putting in thousands of hours to fully flesh out and understand how to accomplish similar systems, and they were uninteresting and just bad through the majority of the development.
