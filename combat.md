### WIP
### Mount & Blade influenced
This gameplay is then placed into an expansive, seamless open-world, with multiple continents only explorable through sailing the vast seas of Almerra.  The vessels are both in-use by the many Nations and purchase-able by the player to be used to freely roam and transport forces and goods.  Certain larger vessels can even transport the various Mounts (within reason) used by heavy cavalry for that extra Age of Empires-influenced kick.

### AI Combat Testing
Almerra is heavily inspired by the Mount & Blade series, using player-driven directional movement and attacks with velocity modifiers to dictate the force behind each swing.  This is partnered with physical materials and other features within Unreal to model the combat stat structures.
