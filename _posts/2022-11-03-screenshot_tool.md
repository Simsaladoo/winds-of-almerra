### Screenshot Tool

As you select cameras from the list, the bottom of the Tool will display the preconstructed directory and name of each image to be exported. It will create this from the path beginning with the show:

    Show Name\artists\User Name\Screenshots\Level Name\Current Date\

Then it will append the following to be used as each screenshots name:

    EnvironmentName_CameraName_VolumeStatus_Date_UserName

You can see this functionality in the below image:

It requires the basic python scripting plugin to be enabled, and an export location to be specified in the Tool's python package:
