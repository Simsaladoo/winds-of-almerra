# 60 Words About the Author
author-about: A displaced young soldier, a character of your creation, begins his tale scrounging across early Iron-age continents in the world of Almerra. Learn friend from foe as you navigate native tribal islands and vibrant capitols among the 5 warring nations. Sooner or later, your nationâ€™s cities and villages will need your help and call on you to make your place in their history, advancing their tale of conquering the vast world through sword, board, and bow combat across plains, deserts, mountains and oceans. Nation-unique warships will crash on the high seas while Fire ballistas, catapults and spiked rams crash against city walls--marking victory for the daft, and defeat for the cautious. Head over to Almerra.com to learn more!
