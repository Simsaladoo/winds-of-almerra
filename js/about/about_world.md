### World Travel

Accessed via the World Map, time compression in Almerra allows for unrestricted passage to anywhere in the world within a short time as long as you are not in combat.
 
The travel system is usable at anytime with the understanding that movement speeds will be greatly reduced as will the number of days required to reach the destination if you are not riding a mount or vessel.

### Mounts

There are all sorts of operational objects within the world including Ships, War Elephants and Siege weapons  beyond the usual Horse and Camel.  Master of them all through commanding your troops will ensure no enemies stand in your way!
