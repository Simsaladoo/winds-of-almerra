### Procedural Economies and Conquest

At the heart of Almerra is the desire for a fully-living iron age world driven by global conquest.

Each hinges on it's ability to feed its people, protect itself thru defenses, and by establishing trade and a healthy economy to achieve prosperity and population.

Nations wage wars thru raids, sieges and naval engagements in real-time, seamless combat.  Command or lead, fight or flight, attack or ambush, sea or land.

Conquer or be conquered.
